How to Use Your Existing Volume (mtb2kqkyin) in RunPod
=======================================================

You already have a volume: mtb2kqkyin

The issue: RunPod's "Edit Pod" creates a NEW volume, not attach an existing one.
The solution: You need to attach your existing volume differently.

OPTION 1: Create New Pod with Your Volume (Recommended)
--------------------------------------------------------
1. Go to RunPod Dashboard
2. Click "Deploy" â†’ "GPU Pod"
3. Configure as before (RTX 4090, PyTorch, etc.)
4. In the pod configuration:
   - Find "Existing Volume" or "Volume" section
   - Select your volume: mtb2kqkyin
   - Set Mount Path: /workspace/volume
5. Deploy the new pod
6. Delete old pod to save costs

OPTION 2: Keep Using /workspace (Current Pod)
-----------------------------------------------
Since your volume is already mounted at /workspace:
1. Keep the current mount path: /workspace
2. Create directory: mkdir -p /workspace/volume
3. Use this path for database: /workspace/volume/database.db
4. All your current pod data is ALREADY in /workspace

OPTION 3: Use Default Volume Disk Size
---------------------------------------
If you just created a volume (mtb2kqkyin):
1. Leave "Volume Disk" at 50 GB (will create new)
2. OR set to 100 GB if you need more space
3. Mount Path: /workspace
4. Your existing volume can be attached in a separate step


Which volume configuration do you see in your RunPod dashboard?
