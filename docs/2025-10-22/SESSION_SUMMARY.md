# Login credentials
Email: demo@colmap.app

# View existing scans
- "Dollhouse Interior Scan" - 1,045,892 points
- "Facade Architecture Scan" - 892,847 points
```

### 2. Upload New Video (5-60 minutes)
1. Click on "Demo Showcase Project"
2. Click "New Scan" button
3. Upload your video (MP4, MOV, etc.)
4. Select quality:
   - **Low:** 5-10 minutes, 10K-30K points
   - **Medium:** 15-25 minutes, 30K-100K points
   - **High:** 30-60 minutes, 100K-500K points
5. Monitor progress in real-time
6. View completed 3D model

### 3. Monitor Processing
```bash
# Watch backend logs
tail -f backend.log

# Watch frontend logs
tail -f frontend.log

# Check health
curl http://localhost:8000/health | python3 -m json.tool

# Check COLMAP status
curl http://localhost:8000/colmap/check | python3 -m json.tool
```

## Key Improvements Verified

### ‚úÖ Best Model Selection
- COLMAP creates multiple reconstruction attempts (sparse/0, sparse/1, etc.)
- System now **automatically selects the best one** (largest points3D.bin)
- This was the main issue causing low point counts before

### ‚úÖ Exhaustive Matching
- **Old:** Sequential matcher (only adjacent frames)
- **New:** Exhaustive matcher (all frame pairs)
- **Result:** Much better 3D coverage and more points

### ‚úÖ More Features Detected
- **Old:** 2K-8K features per frame
- **New:** 8K-32K features per frame
- **Result:** Better feature matching and more accurate reconstruction

### ‚úÖ More Frames Extracted
- **Old:** 10-15 frames per video
- **New:** 40-120 frames per video
- **Result:** More camera angles = better coverage = more 3D points

### ‚úÖ Quality Metrics Tracked
- Real reconstruction statistics from COLMAP database
- Verification rates, mean track length, point counts
- Technical details saved for each scan

# List scans
curl http://localhost:8000/projects/{project_id}/scans

# Scan details
curl http://localhost:8000/scans/{scan_id}/details
```

---

## Troubleshooting

### If backend not responding
```bash
# Check if running
lsof -ti:8000

# Check logs
tail -50 backend.log

# Restart
./start-local.sh
```

### If reconstruction fails
1. Check `backend.log` for error messages
2. Verify COLMAP is installed: `colmap --version`
3. Ensure video is valid: `ffprobe video.mp4`
4. Try lower quality setting

### If out of memory
1. Close other applications
2. Use "low" quality setting
3. Reduce video length to 10-20 seconds
4. Check available RAM: `vm_stat`

- **Medium Quality:** 15-25 minutes per video
- **High Quality:** 30-60 minutes per video

### Point Counts

- **Medium Quality:** 30,000-100,000 points
- **High Quality:** 100,000-500,000 points

## Next Steps (Optional)

### For Better Results
1. **Record better videos:**
   - Move slowly around the object
   - 70-80% overlap between views
   - Good lighting, avoid shadows
   - Sharp focus, avoid motion blur
   - 30-60 seconds minimum
   - 1080p or higher resolution

2. **Increase quality:**
   - Use "medium" or "high" quality settings
   - More processing time but much better results

3. **Enable GPU (if available):**
   - Install CUDA
   - Unset `COLMAP_CPU_ONLY` environment variable
   - Dense reconstruction will be enabled

### For Production
1. Set up proper database (PostgreSQL)
2. Configure cloud storage (S3, GCS)
3. Add user authentication
4. Set up monitoring and alerts
5. Configure automatic backups
