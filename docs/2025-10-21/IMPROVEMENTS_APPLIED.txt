✅ COLMAP IMPROVEMENTS - ALL IMPLEMENTED
==========================================

Based on COLMAP official documentation and best practices:

1. ✅ DATA STRUCTURE
   - Proper workspace organization
   - Multiple sparse models handled correctly
   - Best model selection implemented

2. ✅ FEATURE DETECTION & EXTRACTION
   - Increased from 2K → 8K-32K features (4-16x)
   - Full HD processing (1920px)
   - Domain pooling enabled
   - 6-8 threads utilized

3. ✅ FEATURE MATCHING & VERIFICATION
   - Sequential → Exhaustive matcher
   - 8K → 32K-131K max matches (4-16x)
   - Cross-check enabled
   - Geometric verification active

4. ✅ SPARSE RECONSTRUCTION
   - Optimized mapper parameters
   - More permissive filtering (8.0 vs 4.0)
   - Multiple model attempts (up to 10)
   - Smart best model selection

5. ✅ DATABASE MANAGEMENT
   - Statistics extraction implemented
   - Quality metrics calculated
   - Verification rate tracking
   - Direct SQLite queries

6. ✅ DENSE RECONSTRUCTION
   - GPU mode supported
   - CPU fallback working
   - Sparse PLY export always available

7. ✅ PROCESSING IMPROVEMENTS
   - 7-stage pipeline with detailed logging
   - Real-time statistics
   - Better error handling
   - Proper cleanup

EXPECTED RESULTS:
- Point Count: 10,000-30,000 (was 2,810)
- Processing: 5-10 minutes (was 2-3 min)
- Quality: 10x improvement
- Verification Rate: 70-90%
