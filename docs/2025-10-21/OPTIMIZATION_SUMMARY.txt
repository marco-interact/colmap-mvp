ðŸŽ¯ HIGH-FIDELITY RECONSTRUCTION - OPTIMIZED FOR MAXIMUM POINTS
================================================================

## What Changed:

1. âœ… FRAME EXTRACTION: 10 â†’ 40-50 frames (4-5x MORE)
   - More camera angles = better 3D coverage
   - Leverages local RAM for frame storage

2. âœ… FEATURE DETECTION: 2K â†’ 8K-16K features per image (4-8x MORE)  
   - Full HD processing (1920px)
   - More CPU threads (6-8)
   - Domain pooling enabled

3. âœ… FEATURE MATCHING: Sequential â†’ Exhaustive (ALL PAIRS)
   - Matches every frame with every other frame
   - 32K max matches (4x more)
   - Cross-check enabled for quality

4. âœ… RECONSTRUCTION: Optimized COLMAP parameters
   - More bundle adjustment iterations (40 local, 100 global)
   - More permissive filtering (8.0 max error vs 4.0)
   - More aggressive triangulation
   - Multiple model attempts (up to 10)

## Expected Results:

Before: ~2,810 points
After:  10,000-30,000 points (LOW quality)
        30,000-100,000 points (MEDIUM quality)
        100,000-500,000 points (HIGH quality)

IMPROVEMENT: 3.5-10x MORE POINTS

## Processing Time:

Low quality:    5-10 minutes (was 2-3 min)
Medium quality: 15-25 minutes
High quality:   30-60 minutes

Trade-off: 2-3x longer processing for 10x more points

## RAM Usage:

Low:    2-4 GB
Medium: 4-8 GB  
High:   8-16 GB

Your system RAM is being fully leveraged!

## How to Test:

1. Restart backend:
   ./start-local.sh

2. Upload a new video:
   - Go to http://localhost:3000
   - Create new scan
   - Upload video
   - Quality: "low" (recommended)

3. Wait 5-10 minutes

4. Check results:
   - Point cloud should have 10,000-30,000 points
   - Much more detailed than before
   - Better coverage and density

## Monitoring:

Watch backend log:
   tail -f backend.log | grep -E "Extracting|features|matching|models"

Look for:
- "Extracting 40 frames for high-fidelity reconstruction"  
- "Feature extraction: 8192 features, 1920px max size"
- "Feature matching: exhaustive_matcher, 32768 max matches"
- "âœ“ Created N reconstruction model(s)"
