SCAN FALLBACK ISSUE - FIXED
================================================================================

PROBLEM:
--------
"Scan Test Video 1" was showing Dollhouse demo model instead of the actual 
"Demo Garage 20s.mp4" reconstruction results.

ROOT CAUSE:
-----------
1. Frontend was hardcoded to ONLY show demo models based on scan name
2. The scan's reconstruction didn't include point_cloud_url in results
3. Scan was processed before PLY export feature was implemented
4. Scan ID (e377234c-...) pointed to results from different job (97fba131-...)
   which only had sparse_model.zip, no point_cloud.ply file

SOLUTION IMPLEMENTED:
--------------------
✅ Updated frontend scanId/page.tsx:
   - Added getModelUrl() function with priority chain:
     1. Use scan.results.pointCloudUrl (actual reconstruction)
     2. Use technical_details.results.point_cloud_url (fallback)
     3. Use demo models based on scan name (if no real results)
     4. Default to Dollhouse demo (last resort)
   
✅ Added console logging to track which model is being loaded

✅ Added visual warning banner when showing demo fallback:
   "⚠️ Showing demo model - Re-upload to generate actual 3D reconstruction"

✅ Updated loadScanData() to properly pass results from API:
   - Extracts point_cloud_url, mesh_url, thumbnail_url
   - Includes results in technical_details for backward compatibility

TESTING:
--------
Current Behavior for "Scan Test Video 1":
- Will show Dollhouse demo (no PLY in results)
- Warning banner will appear explaining it's a demo
- Console will show: "⚠️ No reconstruction PLY found, using demo fallback"

Future Uploads:
- Will automatically export PLY during reconstruction
- Will display actual reconstruction results
- No warning banner will appear

RECOMMENDATION:
---------------
User should re-upload "Demo Garage 20s.mp4" to get the actual 3D model.
The new reconstruction will:
1. Extract frames
2. Run COLMAP sparse reconstruction
3. Export sparse model as PLY (NEW!)
4. Display actual garage reconstruction in 3D viewer

================================================================================
Status: ✅ FIXED - Frontend now prioritizes real reconstruction over demos
