🎉 Your 3D rendering is now working on low-power mode!

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

✅ WHAT WAS FIXED:

1. Added missing useGLTF import
2. Enabled low-power GPU mode
3. Disabled antialiasing (faster rendering)
4. Reduced pixel density (better performance)
5. Changed to lighter environment preset
6. Optimized Canvas settings for M2 Mac

🐛 TROUBLESHOOTING:

Black Screen?
  → Check browser console (F12)
  → Enable hardware acceleration
  → Try Chrome/Edge (best performance)

Slow Performance?
  → Already optimized for low-end
  → Close other apps
  → Use "low" quality setting

Can't See Model?
  → Model loads when scan is complete
  → Check scan status is "completed"
  → Wait for COLMAP processing to finish
