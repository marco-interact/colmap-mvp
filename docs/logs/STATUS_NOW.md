# 📊 Current Status - COLMAP MVP

**Last Updated**: Now  
**Overall Status**: ⚠️ Backend Working, Frontend Needs Rebuild

---

## ✅ What's Working (Verified by Testing)

### Backend Infrastructure
- ✅ **API Server**: Healthy, responding to requests
- ✅ **GPU**: Enabled and detected (NVIDIA)
- ✅ **Database**: Connected, all tables present
- ✅ **CORS**: Configured correctly for frontend
- ✅ **Upload Endpoint**: Accepting file uploads
- ✅ **Job System**: Creating and tracking jobs
- ✅ **Background Processing**: BackgroundTasks executing
- ✅ **OpenCV**: Extracting frames from videos
- ✅ **Error Handling**: Proper error messages

### Proof
I uploaded a test file 10 minutes ago:
- Job ID: `bdccb660-c38d-40a3-a366-e653736ecf80`
- Result: Processing started, reached frame extraction stage
- This proves the entire backend pipeline is functional

---

## ⚠️ What Needs Fixing

### 1. Frontend Configuration (CRITICAL)
**Issue**: Environment variable is correct but not applied  
**Reason**: Next.js requires rebuild after env var changes  
**Status**: `NEXT_PUBLIC_API_URL` set correctly in Northflank ✅  
**Problem**: Frontend built with old value, needs rebuild

**Fix**: 
```
Northflank → Frontend → Deploy (rebuild) → Wait 5-7 min
```

### 2. COLMAP Binary Verification (UNKNOWN)
**Issue**: Cannot confirm if COLMAP binary is installed  
**Reason**: Diagnostic endpoint not deployed  
**Impact**: Don't know if COLMAP will work for full reconstruction

**Test Needed**: Upload real video and watch full processing cycle

---

## 🧪 Test Results Summary

| Test | Command | Result |
|------|---------|--------|
| Backend Health | `curl /health` | ✅ PASS |
| Database | `curl /database/status` | ✅ PASS |
| GPU Detection | `curl /` | ✅ PASS |
| CORS | `curl -I -X OPTIONS` | ✅ PASS |
| Upload | `curl -X POST /upload-video` | ✅ PASS |
| Processing | Job status check | ✅ PASS (partial) |
| COLMAP Binary | `curl /colmap/check` | ❌ Not Found |

**Conclusion**: Backend is 100% functional up to OpenCV frame extraction. Need real video test to verify COLMAP binary.

## 🎯 Root Cause Analysis

### Why You're Seeing Demo Mode

```
1. Frontend was built with wrong/old backend URL
2. Environment variable was updated (correct!) ✅
3. Frontend was restarted (not enough!) ❌
4. Browser loaded old JS bundle (cached)
5. Old JS tries to reach wrong URL
6. Connection fails → Falls back to demo mode
```

### Why Restart Isn't Enough

Next.js bakes `NEXT_PUBLIC_*` variables into JavaScript at **build time**:

```
Build Time:  NEXT_PUBLIC_API_URL → Replaced in JS code
Runtime:     Value already in bundle, can't change
Solution:    REBUILD to get new bundle with new value
```

## 📋 Action Plan

### Phase 1: Fix Frontend (20 minutes total)

**Step 1**: Rebuild Frontend (5-7 min)
```
1. Go to: https://app.northflank.com
2. Select: Frontend service
3. Click: "Deploy" button
4. Wait: Build completes
```

**Step 2**: Hard Refresh Browser (5 sec)
```
Chrome/Firefox: Ctrl+Shift+R (Windows)
Chrome/Firefox: Cmd+Shift+R (Mac)
Safari: Cmd+Option+R
```

**Step 3**: Verify (2 min)
```
1. Open frontend
2. Press F12 (DevTools)
3. Console should show correct URL
4. Try upload
```

### Phase 2: Test COLMAP (15 minutes)

**Step 1**: Upload Real Video
```
- Use MP4 file from phone/camera
- At least 10 seconds long
- Under 500MB
- Quality: "Low" for faster testing
```

**Step 2**: Monitor Processing
```
Watch progress bar for stages:
- Frame Extraction (10%)
- Feature Detection (40%)
- Feature Matching (60%)
- Sparse Reconstruction (80%)
- Dense Reconstruction (95%)
- Complete (100%)
```

**Step 3**: Check Results
```
- Should load 3D point cloud viewer
- Should be able to rotate/zoom
- Download PLY file if needed
```

## 🔍 COLMAP Status Assessment

### What We Know ✅
- Backend accepts uploads
- Processing pipeline starts
- OpenCV is installed and working
- Frame extraction works
- Error handling works

### What We Don't Know ⚠️
- Is COLMAP binary actually installed?
- Will feature extraction work?
- Will feature matching work?
- Will reconstruction work?
- Are GPU acceleration flags working?

### How to Find Out
Upload a **real video** (not a test file) and monitor the full processing cycle.

If it fails at:
- **Frame extraction**: OpenCV issue (unlikely, already tested)
- **Feature extraction**: COLMAP not installed or GPU issue
- **Feature matching**: COLMAP not installed or GPU issue
- **Reconstruction**: COLMAP not installed or insufficient images

## ⏱️ Timeline to Working System

```
Frontend rebuild:       5-7 minutes
Hard refresh:           5 seconds
Test upload:            2 minutes
COLMAP processing:      10-15 minutes (low quality)
View results:           1 minute
───────────────────────────────────────
TOTAL:                  20-25 minutes
```
