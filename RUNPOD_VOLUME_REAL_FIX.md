# The REAL Fix: Attach Network Volume During Pod Creation

## What I Got Wrong

I kept saying "Edit Pod â†’ Add Volume" but **YOU CAN'T ADD VOLUMES AFTER CREATION IN THIS UI**.

The "Volume Disk" slider in Edit Pod is just **ephemeral storage** - not your `colmap-storage` network volume.

---

## The REAL Solution

You need to **RECREATE THE POD** with the volume attached during creation.

### Step 1: Note Current Pod Settings

From your Edit Pod screen:
- Container Image: `runpod/pytorch:1.0.2-cu1281-torch280-ubuntu2404`
- HTTP Port: `8000`
- TCP Port: `22`

### Step 2: Create NEW Pod WITH Network Volume

1. **Click "Deploy" or "Create Pod"** in RunPod dashboard
2. **Fill in all fields:**
   - Container Image: `runpod/pytorch:1.0.2-cu1281-torch280-ubuntu2404`
   - HTTP Port: `8000`
   - TCP Port: `22`
   
3. **In the Network Volume section** (should be visible during creation):
   - Click "+ Attach Network Volume"
   - Select: `colmap-storage`
   - Mount Path: `/workspace`
   
4. **Create Pod**

### Step 3: Transfer Your Code

After new pod starts, SSH in:

```bash
# Pull latest code
cd /workspace
git clone https://github.com/marco-interact/colmap-mvp.git

# Or if /workspace already has something, check first
ls -la /workspace
```

### Step 4: Restart Backend

```bash
cd /workspace/colmap-mvp
source venv/bin/activate
nohup python main.py > backend.log 2>&1 &
```

## Alternative: Check if Volume Already Exists

Maybe the volume was already attached? Check in pod:

```bash
mount | grep /workspace
df -h /workspace
```

If you see the volume attached but data still disappears, the issue might be something else.

## Sorry for the Confusion

I misunderstood the RunPod UI. The Edit Pod screen doesn't let you add network volumes - only ephemeral storage.

**YOU NEED TO CREATE A NEW POD WITH THE VOLUME ATTACHED.**
