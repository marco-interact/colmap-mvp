# Network Volume vs S3 Volume

## For Your Use Case: Network Volume is Better

### Network Volume (RECOMMENDED)
- ✅ **Faster** - Direct disk access
- ✅ **Better for databases** - SQLite works great on network volumes
- ✅ **Simple** - No AWS/S3 config needed
- ✅ **Cheaper** - Usually lower cost
- ✅ **Immediate** - No API calls, just file system operations

**Best for:**
- Development and testing
- SQLite databases
- Frequent read/write operations
- Your current use case ✅

### S3 Volume
- ⚠️ **Slower** - API calls for every operation
- ⚠️ **SQLite issues** - S3 is not a real filesystem, SQLite doesn't work well
- ⚠️ **Complex** - Need AWS credentials, bucket setup
- ⚠️ **Cost** - API call costs add up

**Best for:**
- Backup storage
- Large files you read occasionally
- Long-term archives
- NOT your current use case ❌

## Recommendation

**Create a NETWORK VOLUME** named `colmap-storage` with ~50GB.

**Do NOT create S3 volume for this project.**

If you need cloud backups later, you can:
1. Use `rclone` to sync network volume → S3
2. Or use database dumps to backup

---

## What to Do

1. **Create Network Volume** in RunPod
   - Name: `colmap-storage`
   - Size: 50GB (can start smaller)
   
2. **Create new pod** with this volume attached
   - Mount path: `/workspace`
   
3. **That's it!** Your database will persist.
