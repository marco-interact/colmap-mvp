Fix Database Schema - Add Missing Columns
==========================================

The error shows the database doesn't have the new columns. In RunPod terminal:

1. Stop the backend (it's already stopped due to port conflict):
   pkill python

2. Pull the latest code with ALTER TABLE fixes:
   cd /workspace/colmap-mvp
   git pull origin main

3. Start the backend (it will add the missing columns):
   source venv/bin/activate
   nohup python main.py > backend.log 2>&1 &

4. Watch the logs for column additions:
   tail -f backend.log

You should see:
- "✅ Added ply_file column"
- "✅ Added glb_file column" 
- "✅ Added thumbnail column"
- "✅ Demo data created successfully"

5. Test the updated scans:
   curl -s "https://thick-stylish-collaborative-stockings.trycloudflare.com/api/projects/$(curl -s https://thick-stylish-collaborative-stockings.trycloudflare.com/api/projects | jq -r '.projects[0].id')/scans" | jq .

Should now include ply_file, glb_file, and thumbnail fields.
